# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# File Description :
#
# This script is used to set the environment for IBM MQ. The arguments
# specified are passed directly to crtmqenv whose usage is as follows. At
# least one of -m, -n, -p, -r or -s must be specified. Use -s to set up the
# environment for the installation that this script comes from.
#
# crtmqenv usage:
# -j 2.0|3.0         : Set up the environment for JMS 2.0 or 3.0 (Default: 2.0)
# -m name            : Set up the environment for the specified queue manager
# -n name            : Set up the environment for the specified installation
# -p name            : Set up the environment for the installation with the
#                      specified path
# -r                 : Remove IBM MQ from the environment
# -s                 : Set up the environment for the installation that this
#                      script comes from
# -l                 : Set up the library path, appending to the current value
# -k                 : Set up the library path at the start of the current
#                      value
# -x 32|64           : Set up either a 32 or 64-bit environment
#
# The MQ_ENV_OPTIONS environment variable is used to specify options to
# crtmqenv, taking precedence over any positional parameters passed to the
# script.
#
# If this script is not sourced by a Bash shell then LCL_MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH
# must be set so that this script knows where MQ is installed.
